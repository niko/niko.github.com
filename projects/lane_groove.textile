At my current project we're running 10 or 11 services on 7 physical boxes. All of these services share some common configuration (MySQL server name, port, database, username, password? Redis server name, port, database? â€¦) and each of these services also a bunch of individual configuration. At some point I decided that a new configuration file for each new service just doesn't cut it any more and the status of the current configuration files just seemed to prove that: It was a mess.
